## About the Course

The Predictive Analytics elective course is an extension of the Analytics MBA core course, designed to provide a deeper understanding of commonly used methodologies in the realm of forecasting. This course encompasses various topics:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Clustering Approaches
4. Variable/Feature Selection (using subset selection and shrinkage methods)
5. Tree-Based Learning
6. Artificial Neural Networks
7. Time Series Forecasting

This is a multidisciplinary course with wide-ranging applications in fields such as marketing, healthcare, operations management, and finance. We aim to equip you with the skills and tools necessary to apply statistical forecasting methodologies, thus enabling you to make informed decisions in the presence of uncertainty.

The course structure includes lectures and practical computer-based sessions. We'll introduce you to the R programming language and utilize it for applying the methodologies introduced during the course.
